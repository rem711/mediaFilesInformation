# mediaFilesInformation
Java project to list movies and songs and create web pages to manage them

Instead of using something like ITunes to manage my files, and also instead of just check in my files explorer what songs or movies I have on my computer I want to use something that is more user friendly and in the same time match with my need.

So it is a sipmle UI that ask for a folder to start to list your files.
The next is not implemented yet but is comming soon!
After listing your files, it generates web pages where you can find information about your files, and from the index you can list your files, have a quick overview of each, search for a special file (title/genre).

In an other iteration, I think to implement the ability to play the file in your browser.

Technos :
  - Java (default JDK8), Swing for the UI, using Thread to increase the time needed to get files information
  - HTML/CSS/Javascript, I'll probably add Bootstrap or Foundation for the look and feel and to use it js too
